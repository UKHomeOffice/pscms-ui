          This website is run by Border Force. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

        <ul
          className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"
        >
          <li>
            Zoom in up to 300%, without the text spilling off the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reach the main dashboard from every form on COP.
          </li>
          <li>
            Read and navigate the order on COP as it is logical and intuitive/clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tab through questions in the form whilst always having the focus visible.

          className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"
        >
          <li>
            Drop down lists may require users to “type to search” for their options as not all options will be displayed initially.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding additional instances of a response, such as a second passport number/adding a new staff grade in Operational Activity Reporting (OAR), may make the form tab to the top of the page for keyboard only users.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JAWS screen reader does not read options in drop down lists and users are unable to use their keyboard to navigate through drop down lists with JAWS running in the background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Questions on the form and some labels in names, such as the forms page, are unable to be identified by the NVDA screen reader. NVDA is able to read text fields, tabs, links and radio buttons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Headings and titles on COP forms and pages do not get read out by the NVDA screen reader.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fields are only auto completed from information in the user’s profile on COP and not from their browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skip to content does not highlight the body of text that it skips to.
          </li>
          <li>
            The main headings on each page are h2 and not h1.

          </li>
          <li>
            There are some images of text.

            Pre-recorded Audio-only and Video-only (1.2.1) – there is no transcript or audio description provided for Mandatory Declarations and COP reports in the Help pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Captions pre-recorded (1.2.2) – captions are not provided for Mandatory Declarations and COP reports in the Help pages so users unable to read the demo in these videos.

            Audio descriptions or media alternative pre-recorded (1.2.3) and Audio Description (Pre-recorded) (1.2.5) – transcript and audio are not provided to the Mandatory Declarations and COP reports in the Help pages so users are unable to follow the demo via audio/transcripts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reflow (1.4.10) – Mobile users may need to scroll left to right to see some of the COP pages and longer text may spill in drop down lists. Ensure that text does not spill in drop down lists.
          </li>
          <li>
            Info and relationship (1.3.1) – the Dashboard page contains elements other than list items within a set of list elements so screen readers cannot inform the listener that they are listening to items within the list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify input purpose (1.3.5) – we autocomplete from information in the user’s profile in our forms, not from the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contrast (1.4.3) – the charts displayed in the Reports section that display from Power BI don’t provide effective contrast.

          <li>
            Keyboard (2.1.1) – With drop down lists that contain the “type to search” function, users are unable to scroll through the drop down list and then go back to the “type to search” function.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keyboard trap (2.1.2) – the screen reader does not read out all the options in the drop-down list in the port list for Record Border Event and Intelligence Referral forms as not all options are displayed so users will need to use the “type to search” function to find the correct port.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keyboard trap (2.1.2.) – Help for Events at the Border (EaB) and OAR have pages with tables/collapsible fields that are not read by the screen reader and keyboard only users will be unable to access these.

          <li>
            Language of Page (3.1.1) – Single sign-on page lang attribute is required for screen reader to set the language.
          </li>
